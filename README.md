# What's here?
 [radioos.app](https://radioos.app) displays a feed of posts, just like any other social or news app would; yet the special thing is, that every post has earth geographical coordinates associated, which alows you to search nearby specific place that you name.

# Demo
This is a hobby project and is not live per se, but got a demo url with some example data loaded, just so you can see how this works. Visit [https://radioos.app](https://radiooos.app) and key-in some city name in Poland. You can try *Katowice*, *Cracow*, *Warsaw* or any other. On top of that, you can also try some places of interest, too. Each time you enter a place, radioos will convert your input into geo-coordinates of the place you entered and then search its database for posts that are 'positioned' nearby. If there is more than one to display, it will sort posts by distance from the place you chosen.

# Trying & Contributing
When you feel like contributing or trying the code in hot-reload locally, please drop me a DM on twitter or use the contact form in the demo app and I'll help you out! :)
